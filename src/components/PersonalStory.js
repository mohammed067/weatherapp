      <p>
        Once, while traveling, I encountered unexpected heavy rain that disrupted my plans. This experience taught me the importance of accurate and timely weather information. Inspired by this, I designed this dashboard to provide not only current weather but also practical activity suggestions based on the weather and user type.
